# Non Supervised Learning

Non Supervised Learning Models are those models trained using data which does not contains the desired output and make predictions about the labels of new unknown data.

## Clustering
Clustering models group data points based on similarity patterns. These models help identify structure in unlabeled data, making them useful for anomaly detection and pattern recognition.

### K-Means Clustering  
A centroid-based clustering method that partitions data into a predefined number of clusters. It minimizes the variance within each cluster.

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)  
A density-based clustering algorithm that groups points close to each other while marking outliers as noise.

### Agglomerative Clustering  
A hierarchical clustering method that builds clusters by merging smaller ones iteratively.
